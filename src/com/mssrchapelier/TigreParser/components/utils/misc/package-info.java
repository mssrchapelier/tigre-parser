 * <ul>
 * <li>{@link com.mssrchapelier.components.utils.misc.ConfigParseException ConfigParseException}, which is thrown to indicate that a component
 * has failed to parse some part of a configuration file (indicating that it is malformed);</li>
 * <li>{@link com.mssrchapelier.components.utils.misc.LetterType LetterType}, a static class used to determine the type of the phoneme (vowel,
 * consonant, semivowel, laryngeal and some others) represented by the (transliterated) {@code char} passed to one of its methods as an argument.</li>
 * </ul>
